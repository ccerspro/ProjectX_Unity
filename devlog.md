    Start to make the doorwall modular and separate from the corridor prefabs.

6/8/2025:
            Attempt to maintain 3 doorwall objects during runtime. The doorwalls will be separated from the corridorList.
            The doorwall will be instantiated in the Start() method and will be used to represent the door in the game.
            Modularized doorwall completed.

            Start to working on a in game UI system. Consider porting the UI from Lunar Lock
            After reconsideration. There will not be direct porting from Lunar Lock. Though the UI system version 1.0 of the ProjectX will share a very similiar design pattern compare to the one in Lunar Lock
